How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You can see which lines are added and removed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can easily backtrack to previous versions and see when changes introduced bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You only commit at logical places rather than midway through changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Multiple source files work together in a programming project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You enter the commands :p

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If anything breaks, you can easily return to a working state.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try using Git for a sample repository to get acquainted with the commands.
